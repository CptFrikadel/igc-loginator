# IGC Logbook

Small utility to create a logbook from one or more igc files. Intended for use on the OpenVario flight computer.

## Usage

Simply run with a bunch of `.igc` files as argument.

## Cross Compiling

Easiest way to cross compile for OpenVario is to use the bitbake toolchain found in `meta-openvario`.
